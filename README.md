# Statistical-Learning

I'm going through "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R" and even though R is a fantastic programming language, Python except for rare exceptions, contains similar libraries that have the same statistical functionality as in R... I'm looking at you Pandas! (pretty sure 'Pandas' borrowed heavily from 'Tidyverse', need to confirm this conspiracy theory)... So I thought it would be a useful training project to replicate the textbook's exercise solutions and plots in Python alongside some brief notes of the book's content.
